# dogitter

Twitter clone for dogs because why not LMFAO.

For the record: I'm not proud of the UI. It's very very very very very ugly.<br>
When I started, I tried to make a UI to be proud of. But after a while I just went "ah f*ck it". It is what it is ¯\_(ツ)_/¯¯

### Usage

Do you really want to use this? Think twice. Think another time just to be sure.<br>
Anyway, just create a `dogitter` database in MongoDB and a `dogeets` collection inside said table.<br>
Then, just run
```shell
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```
and access `http://localhost:3000`. If all went smoothly, this piece of spaghetti code will be there, "locally live".
